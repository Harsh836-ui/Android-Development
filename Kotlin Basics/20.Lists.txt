	-------LISTS  can be used to hold both both single datatypes and custom types and classes


fun main() {
    val months = listOf(jan, feb, march)
    val anyTypes = listOf(1, 2, 3, true, false, string) list can contain any type of datatype
    println(anyTypes.size)
    accessing item of given list
    for (value in anyTypes) {
        print($value )
    }
    print(n )
we cannot add new items to these list like months and anytypes
therefore we have to convert our immutable list to mutable list

    val additionalMonths = months.toMutableList()
    val newMonths = arrayOf(April, May, June)
    additionalMonths.addAll(newMonths)
    println(additionalMonths) can print it directly

we can also add like
    additionalMonths.add(july)
    println(additionalMonths) can print it directly

    To create a mutable list of anytype
    val days = mutableListOfString(sun, Mon, Tue)
    days.add(Thu)
    println(days)
    override and remove

    days[2] = wednesday
    days.removeAt(3)
    println(days)

    val remList = mutableListOfString(Mon, wednesday)
    To remove all

    days.removeAll(remList) removes the part of list we mentioned
    println(days)

    OR
    days.removeAll(days)
    println(days) remove all items and prints [] empty

    

    days.clear() clears the whole list
    println(days)


}
